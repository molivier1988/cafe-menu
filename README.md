# cafe-menu

## Project overview
Create a simple cafe website to learn basic CSS

## What did I learn

### Styling links with pseudo-class

```css
a: visited
```

```css
a:hover
```

```css
a:active
```

## Semantic HTML
Used for assistive technologies and ***Search Engine Optimisation***

## Reflection
A very simple exercise but did remind me about some basic CSS rules and attributes. In particular centrally aligning items by applying auto to the margin-left and margin-right properties.

This exercise also reminded me of the importance of ***semantic*** html. Also it's perfectly acceptable to use ```<div>``` as a site / page wrapper as long as semantic html is used within in.
